# Fragile

Beware the world is very fragile.

## Manifesto

NFT industry is pretty much a waste of money and potential. ERC-721 standard, however, has very promising capabilities. **Fragile** aims at utilizing those capabilities by channeling them to achievement of greater good. Among some of the **Fragile** usecases:

- Scientific, medical research sponsorship
- Humanitarian donations
- Ecology oriented donations
- Minorities support

## Development

To initialize the project clone the repo into your local file system. Then proceed with the standard npm project set-up:

```
$ npm i
```

Once all dependenicies are installed the project may be started.

### Scripts
1. `$ npm run start` - start the project
2. `$ npm run build` - build the project
3. `$ npm run pretty` - prettify the project
4. `$ npm run lint` - lint the project

Make sure to install **Eslint** and **Prettier** plugins to your IDE/editor not to run them every time from the command line. The environment will do this automatically on every file save.
However, before commiting your changes always run at least prettier as follows:
```
$ npm run pretty
$ git ... (your git routines)
```

Try to remain complient with **Eslint** suggestions.
